## How to install it?
It might help to download the file someplace other than your "downloads" folder so that when you have run out of storage and you do a **ctrl + a ==> delete**, it won't be a wonder when it suddenly disspears

### 1) Save it in a folder,
Make sure you copy the full path, eg:

    users/username/specialprograms/lazygit.sh

### 2) Make it accesible throughout your shell,
Add an alias in your shell profile .zprofile/.zshrc/.bashrc

    alias lgit="sh /Users/gavinsimpson/AAA-GLOBAL-LIBS/lazygit/lazygit.sh"

### 2) Enjoy.
I know that you prob can make your own, but here is my way of making it
