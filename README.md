## Versions
### MacOS and Linux
This has been tested and used on MacOS and will 100% work on Linux
### Windows
This has been checked thoroughly and it looks fine (from my eyes) and as i do not have a windows machine (i do but too "busy" to check, its a windows 8 *cries*) if it doesn't work then make an issue and ill personally see to it that it gets fixed.

It was converted using : https://daniel-sc.github.io/bash-shell-to-bat-converter/

## How to install it?
It might help to download the file someplace other than your "downloads" folder so that when you have run out of storage and you do a **ctrl + a ==> delete**, it won't be a wonder when it suddenly disspears

### 1) Save it in a folder,
Make sure you copy the full path, i saved it a folder called "AAA-GLOBAL-LIBS" eg:

    /Users/username/AAA-GLOBAL-LIBS/lazygit/lazygit.sh"

### 2) Make it accesible throughout your shell,
Add an alias in your shell profile .zprofile/.zshrc/.bashrc

    alias lgit="sh /Users/username/AAA-GLOBAL-LIBS/lazygit/lazygit.sh"

### 2) Enjoy.
I know that you prob can make your own, but here is my way of making it
